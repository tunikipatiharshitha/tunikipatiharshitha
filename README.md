## About:
I'm an ECE Graduate who graduated in 2024 with an overall aggregate of 85% and got trained in VLSI-Physical Design.
## Skills:
* **Physical Design:** Synthesis, Floor-Planning, Placement, CTS, Routing.
* **EDA Tools:** Design Compiler, Genus, Innovus.
* **Process Nodes:** Worked with 28 and 45nm technologies.
* Possess a good understanding of digital electronics, CMOS principles, and Basics of Verilog & TCL scripting. Also good at communication, presentation, and leadership skills.
## Certifications:
* **VSD-Physical Design Flow** from **Udemy** | [Certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-7372f6ff-eb66-42a2-adc4-25a5722d00df/)
* **STEP-certificate for english language proficiency** by The Hindu Group.
  *Obtained language proficiency 8.5/12. | ([STEP-5331462836038070375-20230405155201.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20590843/STEP-5331462836038070375-20230405155201.pdf)
## Academic Projects:
* [Encryption and Decryption using AES and RSA Algorithms](https://github.com/tunikipatiharshitha/Encryption-and-Decryption-using-AES-and-RSA-Algorithms?tab=readme-ov-file#encryption-and-decryption-using-aes-and-rsa-algorithms) : Developed a Hybrid Algorithm using two different Cryptographic Algorithm categories (AES and RSA), increasing the security in several real-time applications. The hybrid AES and RSA algorithm is developed using Verilog HDL and its simulated waveforms are verified.
* [Pulse rate monitoring](https://github.com/tunikipatiharshitha/Pulse-rate-monitoring?tab=readme-ov-file#pulse-rate-monitoring) : Pulse rate monitoring system is an easy and reliable IOT system which gives measure of pulse using pulse sensor.
* [Full custom design of logic gates](https://github.com/tunikipatiharshitha/Full-custom-design-of-logic-gates?tab=readme-ov-file#full-custom-design-of-logic-gates) : Here the logic gates and flip flops are designed and analyzed using Cadence Virtuoso in 90nm and technologies.
* [Patch Antenna](https://github.com/tunikipatiharshitha/Patch-Antenna#patch-antenna) : Designed an Eight-shaped Patch Antenna using Ansys HFSS. Several iterations have been made to make it suitable for multiband applications.
